DevCom Currency Convertor

I've created three files for the Currency Convertor (.html, .css and .js) and three seperate files for the Bonus question i.e. Currency Exchange Arbitrage. To run either, open the respective .html file on Google Chrome, I've added a button in bottom right corner of the page to switch between the two. I have also added pictures used in the same folder.

I have also added screenshots of how the webapge is looking at my PC, they make look a bit different in other PC's. I forgot to deal with this issue as it is my first time making a website. Please overlook this small mistake.

There is additional text and animation displayed when the buttons are hovered over.

Disclaimer:
I took some help from documentation of currencyapi.com from where I borrowed this API Key.
Here is the link for the same: https://currencyapi.com/docs/examples/currency-converter-javascript
The API has 300 free requests, out of which I already made almost 50 requests.
I also took some help from the site that you attached in assignment question statement, i.e.

Some debugging is done by ChatGPT too :)
